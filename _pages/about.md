[//]: # (# 👨🏻‍🎓 About Me)
Hello everyone, my name is Zhongjian Zhang. Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), supervised by [Prof. Chuan Shi](http://www.shichuan.org/ShiChuan_ch.html). 

My research interests primary focus on large language models and trustworthy graph machine learning. Specifically, my current research is mainly about the development of **graph foundation model**.

<span style="color: green;">If you have any questions regarding my work or are interested in collaborating with me, please contact me via email.</span>
